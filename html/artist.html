                <p>Cin’Diego is an underground Hip-Hop artist who hails from San Diego, CA and resides in Cincinnati, OH. He performs West Coast, Southern, East Coast, and Trap styles to catch the attention of the masses in this genre of music.</p>
                
                <p>Cin’Diego’s delivery has a unique story telling ability, abstracting from him a smooth and mob boss demeanor.</p>
                
                <p>Once a member of rap group “Rango Gang,” the three-man group blended the West Coast, South, and Mid-West sound together to make music the world never heard before. One of Cin’Diego’s major accomplishments was winning the “Yo Atlanta Raps Video Awards - The Music Matter Award in 2019 with Rango Gang.</p>
                
                <p>Cin’Diego’s music content comes from the introduction into a side of his family (three generations) of working closely to the Mafia, looked after by Pimps and Trap legends. He tells the stories for those that gave him the game, so you will hear murder music, street life, survival, and how to gain success. 
                  His swag gives way to the West Coast which is what he represents everyday.</p>
                
                <p>Cin’Diego is currently working on his first solo album.</p>
